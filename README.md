# ransomKitty
Ransomware Kit that encrypts all files in a given directory. The decryption method works by first inputting the static password that resides within the decryption program. Then, after inputing the static password, input the secret key that the Encryption program generated, and all the files in the encrypted directory will become decrypted.

Future Upgrade:
- GUI
- Lock screen
- Persistent

Security Mitigation:
- Create a key that shutdown the encryption program (i.e. worst case scenario)
